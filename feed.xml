                <p>The best poetry (art?)
(unfolds itself in fighting)
is made 
when
you can’t find (locate)
in the world
what
you so desperately need.</p>
<p>In writing
the loss and in
(voicing, wailing?) speaking the eulogy, and 
deeply mourning,
we bring about
what we needed.</p>
<p>(Joys?)</p>
<p>And most importantly,
in that final turn,
realize (realizing?)
(a pain fully felt is never yours)
the pain was never yours.</p>
<p>(It is fleeting)</p>
<p>Just a way 
for you to create;
terraform
and leave behind
the breadcrumbs (compost, tree motif)
for what’s (whatever’s) to come.</p>
<hr>
<p>title words: terraform, cultivate, till, </p>
